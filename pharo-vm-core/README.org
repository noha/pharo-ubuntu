* pharo-vm-core

This directory is for creating the ~pharo-vm-core~ Debian
meta-package. This package has no content and only dependencies. The
idea is that installing this package will install the right Pharo
Virtual Machine (VM) depending on your architecture.

** How to update the package

When you want to change this package (should only be done on rare
occasions):

#Go to the ~pharo-vm-core~ directory, make your changes, update the
~debian/changelog~ file, run ~debuild -S~

** How it works

The important file here is ~pharo-vm-core/debian/control~ which
indicates the dependencies.

The ~Depends:~ line contains a reference to ~pharo-vm-core-i386~ that
is the real VM binary package. The Debian Multiarch system will take
care of installing the dependency even if the target architecture is
not i386.

The ~Architecture: all~ line indicates that the package is independent
of the architecture, should be built only once for all possible
architectures, and can be installed anywhere.
